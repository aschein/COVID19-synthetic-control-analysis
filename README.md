# COVID19 synthetic contro analysis
This repository performs a synthetic control analysis on COVID19 data. The jupyter notebook files are in the same directory as tslib, where the tslib library should be. 


There are different datasets used for this analysis which are not included to this repository for space constraints. The following image shows the data hierarchy for those.
